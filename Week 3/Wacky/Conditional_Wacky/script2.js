// this is just a funny little thing that will spit out a code

var name = prompt('Hey help me out and enter your name under here. ');// collecting name
var numOne = prompt('How much wood could a Woodchuck chuck?'); // collecting data from person
var numTwo = prompt('How many guitarists does it take to screw in a light bulb?'); // collecting data for code
var answer = numOne * numTwo; // multiplying number one and number two

(answer > 100) ? console.log(name + ', I can only please one person per day. Today isn\'t your day...and tomorrow doesn\'t look good either.') : console.log( + ',Your weirdness is creeping my imaginary friend out. And if you don\'t stop it...he seriously just might eat you. ');
